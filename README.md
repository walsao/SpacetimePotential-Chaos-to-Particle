# SpacetimePotential-Chaos-to-Particle
Simulates particles emerging from spacetime curvature. Voltage acts as a potential field; particles evolve from chaos into structure based on real physics (âˆ‡V). A visual and mathematical exploration of how motion, form, and identity may arise from the geometry of space itself.
